   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: There are 6 window/glass door(s) that may cause inaccurate shadowing due to Solar Distribution.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each window, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ************* Note that the following warning(s) may/will occur if you have not enclosed your zone completely.
   ** Warning ** Entered Zone Volumes differ from calculated zone volume(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CalculateZoneVolume: 1 zone is not fully enclosed. For more details use:  Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtrawarnings;
