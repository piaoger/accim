    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the capabilities of the **accim** library, specifically the `apmv_setpoints` module. This tool allows researchers and engineers to dynamically modify EnergyPlus models (IDF) to implement **Adaptive Predicted Mean Vote (aPMV)** control strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard PMV models often fail to account for the psychological and physiological adaptation of occupants in naturally ventilated or mixed-mode buildings. The **aPMV** model introduces an adaptive coefficient ($\\lambda$) to correct this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ aPMV = \\frac{PMV}{1 + \\lambda \\times PMV} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "By using this library, you can inject Energy Management System (EMS) code into your IDF to calculate aPMV in real-time and adjust HVAC setpoints to maintain comfort within specific adaptive limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives of this Notebook\n",
    "1.  **Load and Inspect** a residential EnergyPlus model.\n",
    "2.  **Identify Control Targets** (Zones/Spaces) automatically.\n",
    "3.  **Prepare the Model** by adding a VRF HVAC system and occupancy schedules.\n",
    "4.  **Apply aPMV Logic** with custom adaptive coefficients for different zones.\n",
    "5.  **Simulate and Visualize** the dynamic setpoint adjustments."
