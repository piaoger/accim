   ** Warning ** Weather file location will be used rather than entered (IDF) Location object.
   **   ~~~   ** ..Location object=CICSE ALJARAFE CENTER (01-01:31-12)  (01-01:31-12)
   **   ~~~   ** ..Weather File Location=SEVILLA - ESP IWEC Data WMO#=083910
   **   ~~~   ** ..due to location differences, Latitude difference=[0.00] degrees, Longitude difference=[0.00] degrees.
   **   ~~~   ** ..Time Zone difference=[0.0] hour(s), Elevation difference=[244.44] percent, [22.00] meters.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Entered Zone Floor Areas differ from calculated Zone Floor Area(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: There are 6 window/glass door(s) that may cause inaccurate shadowing due to Solar Distribution.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each window, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ************* Note that the following warning(s) may/will occur if you have not enclosed your zone completely.
   ** Warning ** Entered Zone Volumes differ from calculated zone volume(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CalculateZoneVolume: 1 zone is not fully enclosed. For more details use:  Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtrawarnings; 
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 6 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Severe  ** ZoneControl:Thermostat:ThermalComfort="PLANTAX08:OFFICE COMFORT CONTROL" invalid Zone or ZoneList Name="PLANTAX08:OFFICE" zone previously assigned.
   **   ~~~   ** ...Zone was previously assigned to Thermostat="PLANTAX08:OFFICE COMFORT CONTROL".
   ** Severe  ** GetStagedDualSetpoint: Errors with invalid names in ZoneControl:Thermostat:StagedDualSetpoint objects.
   **   ~~~   ** ...These will not be read in.  Other errors may occur.
   **  Fatal  ** Errors getting Zone Control input data.  Preceding condition(s) cause termination.
   ...Summary of Errors that led to program termination:
   ..... Reference severe error count=2
   ..... Last severe error=GetStagedDualSetpoint: Errors with invalid names in ZoneControl:Thermostat:StagedDualSetpoint objects.
   ************* Warning:  Node connection errors not checked - most system input has not been read (see previous warning).
   ************* Fatal error -- final processing.  Program exited before simulations began.  See previous error messages.

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).

   ************* EnergyPlus Warmup Error Summary. During Warmup: 0 Warning; 0 Severe Errors.
   ************* EnergyPlus Sizing Error Summary. During Sizing: 5 Warning; 2 Severe Errors.
   ************* EnergyPlus Terminated--Fatal Error Detected. 11 Warning; 2 Severe Errors; Elapsed Time=00hr 00min  1.43sec
